# VAE-based Medical Image Generator
## Idea:
Generate images from different imaging modalities by training on MedMNIST dataset

## Basic Task:
Implement and train VAE to generate medical images from MedMNIST dataset

## Extension:
Implement VAE variant for (a) disentanglement or (b) conditional training and evaluate for >= 3 different modalities (e.g. X-ray, Pathology, Dermatology)
